1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower
age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5
sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)
parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson

Please load the source file and analyze its content.
According to the variables you have, begin by listing 3 interesting questions that could be asked on this data, for instance about specific correlations with survival rate.
Then answer these questions one by one, by finding the relevant numbers.
Meanwhile, plot some figures using matplotlib/seaborn and save them to the (already existing) folder './figures/': take care to clear each figure with plt.clf() before doing another plot.

In your final answer: summarize these correlations and trends
After each number derive real worlds insights, for instance: "Correlation between is_december and boredness is 1.3453, which suggest people are more bored in winter".
Your final answer should have at least 3 numbered and detailed parts.
